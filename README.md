# What is it?

**Play That Song** is a song request app for DJs and club venues. The app has two user interfaces - the screen that the DJ sees, and the screen that the attendee of the event sees. The attendees can log in through their mobile devices to request a song, which will then appear on the screen of the DJ’s device.
