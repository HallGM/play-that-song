# What is it?

**Play That Song** is a song request app for DJs and club venues. The app has two user interfaces - the screen that the DJ sees, and the screen that the attendee of the event sees. The attendees can log in through their mobile devices to request a song, which will then appear on the screen of the DJâ€™s device.

# How to use

## DJ Screen

The first page and the main page that you are greeted with is the DJ *request* page. Incoming requests will appear in blue, and once you check them off, they will appear on the grey *played* list

As the DJ, you can add, edit and delete user profiles in the *Users* page. You can also add edit and delete songs in the *Songs* page.

## Switching to attendee interface mode

In the users page, click on one of the users and this will take you to their user profile. From here, click *use app as this user* to see the device from this user's perspective. 
(This is not an intended feature, and just here to simulate a user logging into the app)

## Attendee Interface

This part of the user interface is optimized for mobile users. Users can request a song, see a list of all songs that have been played, or se a list of all songs that they have requested.
