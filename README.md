# What is it?

**Play That Song** is a song request app for DJs and club venues. The app has two user interfaces - the screen that the DJ sees, and the screen that the attendee of the event sees. The attendees can log in through their mobile devices to request a song, which will then appear on the screen of the DJâ€™s device.

# How to use

## Attendee Interface

This part of the user interface is optimized for mobile users. Users can request a song, see a list of all songs that have been played, or se a list of all songs that they have requested.
